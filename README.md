# Telegram-Image-classifier
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow. It integrates with Telegram to classify images sent by users into predefined categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CNN model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
